##  A class for processing and calculating minimum, currrent and maximum print time.
#
#   This class contains all the logic relating to calculation and slicing for the
#   time/quality slider concept. It is a rather tricky combination of event handling
#   and state management. The logic behind this is as follows:
#
#   - A scene change or settting change event happens.
#        We track what the source was of the change, either a scene change, a setting change, an active machine change or something else.
#   - This triggers a new slice with the current settings - this is the "current settings pass".
#   - When the slice is done, we update the current print time and material amount.
#   - If the source of the slice was not a Setting change, we start the second slice pass, the "low quality settings pass". Otherwise we stop here.
#   - When that is done, we update the minimum print time and start the final slcice pass, the "high quality settings pass".
#   - When the high quality pass is done, we update the maximum print time.
#
