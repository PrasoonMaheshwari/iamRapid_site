Cura 15.06 is a new release built from the ground up on a completely new

New Features
------------

* Plugin based system
  The Uranium framework provides us with a plugin-based system
  that provides additional flexibility when extending Cura. Think
  of new views, tools, file formats, etc. This is probably the
  biggest new feature.
* Improved UI
  The UI has received a complete overhaul.
* Time-Quality Slider
  The 4 static quick print profiles have been replaced with
  a slider that should make it easier to find the right spot
  between print time and print quality.
* More Settings
  The Advanced mode is now configurable and can show many
  additional settings that were previously not available, while at
  the same time not overwhelming new users with too many settings.
  Custom set of visible settings can be created by the user.
* Support for high-DPI screens
  The refreshed UI has been designed with high-DPI screens in
  mind which should improve the experience of Cura on such
  devices.
* Improved language support
  (Not yet available for the Beta release.)
* Improved support structure generation
  The new version of the CuraEngine now features improved
  support generation algorithms and additional options for support
  structure generation.
* Experimental Feature: Wire Printing
  Wire Printing has been added as an experimental new feature. It
  will print objects as a structure of lines. It can be enabled by
  from Advanced Mode -> Fixes -> Wire Printing.
* Undo/Redo
  It is now possible to undo and redo most scene operations, like
  moving or rotating objects.

Features from earlier versions not (yet) in this release
--------------------------------------------------------

* The All-at-once/One-at-a-time toggle is not available.
  We are working on an improved implementation of this mechanism
  but it will not be available for this release.
* No dual extrusion features are available yet.
  We are working on a completely new workflow for this but this
  needs additional time.
* “Lay Flat” has been removed.
  The existing implementation was unfortunately not salvageable.
  We will be looking into an improved implementation for this
  feature.
* "Split Object Into Parts" has been removed.
  Due to the same reason as Lay Flat.
* Support for AMF and DAE file formats has been removed.
  Both of these will be implemented as plugins in the future.
* Support for directly loading a GCode file is not yet available.
  This will be implemented as a plugin in the future.
* Support for PNG, JPG and other image formats has been removed.
  These can be supported by a plugin with an improved UI.
* Support for loading Minecraft levels has been removed.
  This can be implemented as a plugin.
* Windows XP support has been dropped.
  Microsoft is no longer supporting xp, so they no longer back
  port certain features that we require.
* X-Ray view is missing.
  Will be implemented as a (you might have guessed it) plugin.
* Fixes: Follow Mesh Surface
  Has been removed from the engine, the same result can be
  achieved using no infill or top/bottom layers.

Known Issues
------------

For an up to date list of all known issues, please see

* Some OBJ files are rendered as black objects due to missing
  normals.

  after midnight.
